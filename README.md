## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for any programmer or computer scientist. This repository is designed to offer clear explanations, example implementations, and exercises for a variety of data structures and algorithms using C.

## Data Structures

This repository covers the following major data structures:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

Each data structure comes with detailed explanations, visualizations, and C code implementations.

## Algorithms

The repository covers a wide range of algorithms, including:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

Each algorithm is explained thoroughly, and C code implementations are provided for better understanding.
